**Data Science Project: Customer Churn Prediction**

**Abstract**

This project outlines the development of a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. Leveraging a combination of data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and deployment, the project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at high risk of churn. The resulting model is then deployed as a Flask API, enabling real-time predictions and integration with other applications.

**Overview**

**1. Project Definition and Data Collection**

* **Problem:** Predict customer churn for a telecommunications company.
* **Data Sources:**
    * **Internal Data:** Customer demographics, subscription details, usage patterns, customer support interactions, billing history.
    * **External Data:** (Optional) Economic indicators, competitor information, market trends.

**2. Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outlier detection and treatment, data type conversion.
* **Data Transformation:** Feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering.
* **EDA:** Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to understand data distributions, relationships between features, and identify potential drivers of churn.

**3. Model Selection and Training**

* **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine).
* **Model Training:** Split data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, and tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

**4. Model Evaluation**

* **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
* **Model Comparison:** (If multiple models are tested) Compare performance metrics to select the best model.

**5. Model Deployment (Flask)**

* **Create a Flask Application:** Develop a Flask application to serve the trained model as an API.
* **API Endpoint:** Define an API endpoint to receive input data and return churn predictions.
* **Preprocessing and Prediction:** Implement data preprocessing and prediction logic within the API.

**6. Testing and Monitoring**

* **API Testing:** Test the API functionality using tools like Postman or curl.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Track API usage, response times, and model performance over time.

**7. (Optional) Web App**

* **Create a Front-End:** Develop a simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the Flask API.
* **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface for inputting customer data and displaying churn predictions.

**Key Deliverable:**

* **Deployed API:** A functional Flask API that accepts customer data as input and returns the predicted churn probability.

This project demonstrates a practical application of data science principles, from data collection and preparation to model development and deployment. The resulting API can be integrated into various applications, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, to proactively identify and address customer churn risks.
